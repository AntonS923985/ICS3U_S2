#I predict the number 24 will be printed on the console.

print(24)

#My prediction was correct, the number 24 was printed.

#I got the output I did because the print command is used to display text on a console, and when I ran it, the text in between the brackets was printed.

#Modify 1

amount = 24

print("2 dozen is:" , amount)


#Modify 2

amount = 7*4

print("Twenty eight is:" , amount)

#Modify 3

amount = 8
amount = amount+1
print("The amount is:" , amount)

#This is happening because the + sign is telling the console to add the value of 1 to the current value of the amount.

#Modify 4

amount = 8
amount = amount*2
print("The amount is:" , amount)

#This is happening because the * sign represents multiplication, therefore the console multiplies the amount variable by the number entered.
